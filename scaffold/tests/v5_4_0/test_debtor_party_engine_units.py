"""v5.4.0 unit tests — §17 debtor party engine.

Added in v5.4.0 Session 2; extended in v5.4.0 Session 7. Wired into run_all.py
via scaffold/tests/v5_4_0/. Exercises debtor_party_engine across the full §17
surface:

  - all 29 §17.C mapped doc types resolve to a real debtor (17 from Session 2
    plus the 12 Session-7 doc types: tax_deed, tax_foreclosure_notice,
    tax_sale_certificate, sheriff_sale_surplus, eviction_filing,
    writ_of_possession, divorce_filing, final_decree_of_divorce,
    marital_property_division, bankruptcy_petition, condemnation_notice,
    demolition_order);
  - the F-5 default rule routes an unmapped doc type to REVIEW_REQUIRED with
    review_reason "no_debtor_rule_for_doc_type";
  - the §17.F owner-type classifier across all 5 outputs;
  - the §17.D filer-suppression groups — the 7 Session-2 groups and the 9
    Session-7 groups added for the operator-supplied debtor rules.
  - the Session-7 document-only-resolution path: when a record carries only a
    parcel / address / case number / tenant — but no debtor — the engine
    routes to REVIEW_REQUIRED "owner_not_on_document" (§17 must NOT attempt
    parcel / assessor / tax-roll / GIS resolution; that is §13.14).
  - Rule 7 — bankruptcy: a petition with no real-property hook routes to
    REVIEW_REQUIRED "no_property_connection". The lead is NOT dropped.
  - Rule 6 — divorce: both spouses go in the multi-owner block. A clear
    awarded-to spouse → MULTIPLE_OWNERS_PRIMARY_CLEAR; otherwise
    MULTIPLE_OWNERS_PRIMARY_UNCLEAR + debtor_resolution_status REVIEW_REQUIRED.

Every resolve_debtor_party call self-validates its output against
debtor_resolved_record.schema.json (the engine raises ValueError on a
non-conforming record), so a clean return is also a schema-conformance check.
