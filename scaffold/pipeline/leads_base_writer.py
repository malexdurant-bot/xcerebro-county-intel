leads_base_writer — v5.4.0 staged pipeline, stage 3 (the base-file writer).

STATUS: IMPLEMENTED in v5.4.0 Session 3. This stage takes debtor-resolved
records (debtor_resolved_record.schema.json), stamps each with its §18.B
aggregation key and resolved signal_type, attaches the §13.14 status pair
(parcel_resolution_status, enrichment_status) and the §18.J confidence_status,
and writes the stable per-source base file `<source>_leads_base.json`
(leads_base_record.schema.json).

Contracts:
  - knowledge_base/architecture/18_signal_aggregation_contract.md (the key,
    and the §18.J Session 3 amendment)
  - knowledge_base/architecture/19_aggregator_idempotency_rule.md (base files)
  - knowledge_base/protocols/02_build_mode_protocol.md §02.4 (writer duties)
  - knowledge_base/architecture/13_lead_origination_contract.md §13.14
    (parcel_resolution_status / enrichment_status decoupling)

§19.C makes the base file the load-bearing artifact: it is the ONLY input the
aggregator reads. Each base file is per-source and stable; the aggregator
re-derives `matched_leads.json` from the base files on every run, never from
its own previous output. One base record is written per debtor-resolved event —
within-source and cross-source grouping is the aggregator's job (§19), not
pre-collapsed here, so aggregation stays idempotent from a stable base.

§18.J — confidence_status: a record's confidence is rolled up ONCE here, by
`derive_confidence_status`, from the §08 evidence-ledger entries the record's
evidence_ids point to (the dashboard never computes confidence itself). The
roll-up is the weakest-evidence rule: a lead is never labelled more confident
than its least-supported claim.

Every base record MUST carry `source_url`, `instrument_number`, `recorded_date`,
and `evidence_ids` (§02.4). A lead is NEVER dropped because enrichment failed
(§13.14); the base record is written before enrichment runs, so
`enrichment_status` is always UNENRICHED at this stage.

This module is universal framework code: the `<source>_leads_base.json` naming
convention, the confidence roll-up rule, and the §13.14 status derivation are
universal; the per-county signal_type labels are passed in at call time. No
county / state / vendor literal appears here.
