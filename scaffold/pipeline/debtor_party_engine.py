debtor_party_engine — v5.4.0 staged pipeline, stage 2 (the §17 engine).

STATUS: IMPLEMENTED in v5.4.0 Session 2. This module resolves the debtor /
lead subject for one raw event record per the §17 Debtor Party Rules. The
behavioral spec is scaffold/tests/v5_4_0/test_debtor_party_engine_behavior.py,
test_filer_suppression_behavior.py, and test_debtor_party_engine_units.py.

Contract: knowledge_base/architecture/17_debtor_party_rules.md.

This engine takes a raw event record (raw_event_record.schema.json) and
resolves the debtor / lead subject — the party in the source record that is
the property owner being acted against — distinct from the filer, lienholder,
or claimant. It emits a debtor-resolved record
(debtor_resolved_record.schema.json), which it validates before returning.

Why this engine exists (§17.B): different doc types invert party roles
differently. A naive translator that takes the first-named party as "owner"
produces filer-as-owner inversions — it would name the hospital as the owner
of a hospital lien, the IRS as the owner of a federal tax lien, the lender as
the owner of a foreclosure. §17 specifies, per canonical_doc_type, which party
is the debtor.

v5.4.0 finding F-1, RATIFIED Session 2 (see §17.K): this engine records its
verdict in `debtor_resolution_status` only. It MUST NOT write
`parcel_resolution_status` — that is a downstream parcel-stage field.

v5.4.0 finding F-5, resolved for Session 2 and extended in Session 7: the §17.C
table covers 29 canonical doc types — 17 mapped in Session 2 plus 12 added in
Session 7 (the 9 operator-supplied debtor rules: tax sale/deed, tax certificate,
surplus, eviction, divorce, bankruptcy, condemnation, demolition, keyed onto
the canonical_doc_types.json registry's lowercased names — tax_deed,
tax_foreclosure_notice, tax_sale_certificate, sheriff_sale_surplus,
eviction_filing, writ_of_possession, divorce_filing, final_decree_of_divorce,
marital_property_division, bankruptcy_petition, condemnation_notice,
demolition_order). A canonical_doc_type with NO §17.C rule row hits the DEFAULT
rule — route to REVIEW_REQUIRED with review_reason
"no_debtor_rule_for_doc_type". The engine NEVER guesses a debtor for an unmapped
doc type and NEVER silently passes it through. tax_delinquency is intentionally
NOT a §17 doc type — it is a tax-roll STATUS, not a recorded document; it is
enrichment, not §17.

Post-Session-8 operator gap-fill: three more `lead_generating` P0 registry doc
types — quitclaim_deed, partition_action, quiet_title_action — were found with
no §17.C rule row (falling through to the F-5 default on every real record)
and were added below the Session-8 fan-out block. `vacated_judgment` was
checked and deliberately left unmapped — it is `source_class: negative_signal`
(suppresses JUDGMENT_LIEN), the same category as the other release/discharge
doc types, none of which carry a §17 rule.

Session 7 also formalises DOCUMENT-ONLY RESOLUTION (§17.K): the §17 engine
resolves the debtor solely from parties NAMED ON THE DOCUMENT. Several of the
new doc types (tax_foreclosure_notice, eviction_filing, writ_of_possession,
condemnation_notice, demolition_order, and the divorce types) frequently carry
no owner name on the record — only a parcel / address / case number / tenant —
and the engine MUST route such records to REVIEW_REQUIRED with review_reason
"owner_not_on_document" rather than attempt parcel / assessor / tax-roll / GIS
resolution itself (that is the downstream §13.14 parcel-resolution stage).

This module is universal framework code: the §17.C debtor_party_rules table
and the §17.D filer-suppression patterns are universal; the per-county
doc-type taxonomy and any county-specific suppression additions are passed in
at call time. No county / state / vendor literal appears here.

# §17.C — the universal debtor_party_rules table.
#
# Rule row shape:
#   expected_debtor_name_type  the name_type carrying the debtor identity
#   fallback_debtor_name_type  secondary name_type if the primary is absent
#   filer_name_types           name_type(s) whose parties are filers (used to
#                              populate filer_entity — best-effort, see F-6)
#   debtor_source              "STRUCTURED" (name_type fields) or
#                              "DOCUMENT_BODY" (extracted from document text)
#   known_filer_role           descriptive label of the filer's role. §17.C
#                              names filer pattern-sets ("plaintiff patterns",
#                              "contractor patterns", "executor/administrator
#                              patterns", "heir-affiant patterns", "sheriff/
#                              marshal patterns") that §17.D does NOT
#                              enumerate — finding F-6, an open gap. This
#                              engine implements only the concretely-defined
#                              §17.D patterns; known_filer_role is descriptive
#                              metadata, not an executable pattern set.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Session 7 extension fields a rule row MAY carry:
#   missing_debtor_review_reason  override for the REVIEW_REQUIRED review_reason
#                                 when the structured debtor is absent. The 12
#                                 Session-7 rules all use "owner_not_on_document"
#                                 (the document-only-resolution rule); the
#                                 pre-Session-7 rules keep the default message
#                                 "expected_debtor_name_type <X> missing".
#   debtor_source values added in Session 7:
#     BANKRUPTCY_STRUCTURED       Rule 7 — TP is the debtor, but the engine
#                                 first checks for a real-property connection on
#                                 property_refs and routes to REVIEW_REQUIRED
#                                 "no_property_connection" when none is present.
#                                 Contact context (signer / managing-member /
#                                 registered-agent / principal) is ENRICHMENT,
#                                 NOT §17 — it is deliberately not added here.
#     DIVORCE_MULTI_OWNER         Rule 6 — both spouses go in the Session 7A
#                                 multi-owner block. The decree's document body
#                                 may "AWARD" / "ORDER TO SELL" / "TRANSFER" the
#                                 property to one named spouse — when so, that
#                                 spouse is_primary and multi_owner_status is
#                                 MULTIPLE_OWNERS_PRIMARY_CLEAR. Otherwise both
#                                 spouses are preserved with no is_primary,
#                                 multi_owner_status MULTIPLE_OWNERS_PRIMARY_UNCLEAR
#                                 and debtor_resolution_status REVIEW_REQUIRED —
#                                 ownership priority is never guessed.

# v5.4.0 Session 8 — broad-key → registry-doc-type fan-out.
#
# The §17.C contract (Session 2) defined several BROAD doc-type rule keys
# (`abstract_of_judgment`, `civil_judgment`, `code_lien`, `foreclosure_notice`,
# `probate`, `trustee_sale`) that do not match any single canonical_doc_types.json
# registry key. After the v5.4.0 cutover, the staged engine consumes lowercased
# REGISTRY keys (the monolith's normalize_doc_type emits registry UPPERCASE
# values; the bridge lowercases them). Session 8 reconciles the two namespaces:
# for each broad key, the SAME §17 rule is registered under every fine-grained
# registry doc type it covers, so the staged engine resolves correctly after
# cutover. The broad keys are retained as backward-compat aliases.
#
# `administrative_lien` is a broad CATEGORY whose registry-aligned children
# (`federal_tax_lien`, `state_tax_lien`, `municipal_lien`) each carry their own
# §17 rule rows already; the broad rule has no further fan-out and remains as
# documentation.
#
# Where two broad keys cover the same registry doc type (e.g. `foreclosure_notice`
# and `trustee_sale` both cover `notice_of_substitute_trustee_sale`), the alias
# is assigned to one canonical broad key (here, the foreclosure_notice fan-out)
# so the registry-keyed rule row is defined exactly once. The two broad rules'
# logic is identical (DOCUMENT_BODY extraction, mortgagor / grantor / debtor
# labels) so the assignment is operationally neutral.

         with review_reason "no_debtor_rule_for_doc_type".
      2. Extract the debtor by `debtor_source`:

           `expected_debtor_name_type`; if absent, the fallback name_type;

         (§17.D) matches the proposed owner. The lead is NEVER dropped. For
