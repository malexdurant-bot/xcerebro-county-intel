aggregator — v5.4.0 staged pipeline, stage 4 (the idempotent §19 aggregator).

STATUS: IMPLEMENTED in v5.4.0 Session 4. This stage reads the stable per-source
base files (`<source>_leads_base.json`) and produces `matched_leads.json`,
applying the §18 aggregation rules under the §19 idempotency contract.

Contracts:
  - knowledge_base/architecture/18_signal_aggregation_contract.md
  - knowledge_base/architecture/19_aggregator_idempotency_rule.md

Two-level grouping:

  1. SIGNAL grouping (§18.B) — leads-base records are grouped by the §18
     aggregation-key tuple (canonical_doc_type is the authoritative grouping
     discriminator, per the Session 3 F-4 resolution). Null-parcel records use
     the §18 F-3 fallback identity (instrument_number, else raw_event_id), so
     two distinct unresolved properties never collapse into one signal. Each
     group is merged into one signal by `merge_signal_group` (§18.C).
  2. LEAD grouping — signals are grouped into one matched lead per property:
     by parcel_id for RESOLVED parcels, by the F-3 fallback identity for
     null-parcel records.

§18.E / §18.F: a signal's `count` is the number of DISTINCT events — distinct
non-null instrument_numbers plus each null-instrument record. Two records that
share an instrument number are the same event ingested twice (a true
duplicate) and collapse to one; records with distinct instruments are
legitimate signal stacking and are each counted. Distinct doc types on one
property stay distinct signals (§18.F anti-collapse).

§19 idempotency — the load-bearing invariant:
  - the aggregator reads ONLY `*_leads_base.json` files (§19.C);
  - it NEVER reads its own output (`matched_leads.json`, `dashboard/data.json`)
    — `aggregate` refuses such an input with ValueError (§19.B / §19.C);
  - every step is deterministic (stable sorts, stable ids), so running twice
    on the same base files yields byte-identical `matched_leads.json` (§19.D);
  - when `aggregate` writes output it runs the §19.E self-check and refuses to
    deploy (raises) if the second run differs.

The matched-lead owner-identity fields (owner_name, owner_type, filer_entity,
review_reason, parcel_resolution_status, enrichment_status) are taken from a
deterministic representative leads-base record — the one with the
lexicographically smallest base_record_id in the property group. §18/§19 do
not specify multi-record owner derivation; this rule is deterministic, which
§19.D requires. Within a real property group the owner fields agree; the rule
only ever acts as a stable tie-break.

This module is universal framework code: the `<source>_leads_base.json` naming
convention and the aggregation rules are universal; the per-county base-file
inventory is read from config/counties/<county_slug>.json. No county / state /
vendor literal appears here.
